# deformation_graph
I wrote a deformation graph code for Embedded deformation. The deformation graph is like the following:

The deformation graph is generated using farthest point sampling algorithm and 
the code is based on the fast marching code from Professor Gabriel Peyre to compute
geodesic distance. If you need the complete deformation graph code,please contact me 
through email from a university email such as youremail@youruniversity.edu.
